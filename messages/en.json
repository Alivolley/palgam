If your gaming activities have a negative impact on yourself or others, and the limits you have set are not sufficient to control your gaming behavior, we suggest taking a break for as long as you deem necessary. \n The 'Self-Exclusion' feature can be activated through Telegram chat or by sending an email to our support at support@palgam.com. \n \n  After submitting the exclusion request, the player will receive a form via email that must be filled out (desired duration of exclusion, reason, etc.). \n Upon completing the form, the member's account will be blocked by our support team for the period specified by the player. Please note that access to your account will not be allowed until the end of this period."
